;; Teaches clj-kondo the shape of:
;;
;;   Classic mode:
;;     (defroute fn-name [extra-dep1 extra-dep2]
;;       "METHOD" "/path"
;;       body...)
;;
;;   Pre-handler mode:
;;     (defroute fn-name [extra-dep1 extra-dep2]
;;       "METHOD" "/path"
;;       [guard-fn1 guard-fn2]
;;       body...)
;;
;; The hook generates:
;;
;;   (defn fn-name [_app _runtime _config deps]
;;     (let [<only symbols referenced in body+guards> (get deps :symbol) ...]
;;       (^:async fn [ctx]            ; or [_ctx] when ctx is unused
;;         [guards-if-any] body...)))
;;
;; The body is wrapped in an ^:async fn that mirrors the handler the
;; runtime macro emits.  Modeling the async fn boundary means await and
;; raw Promise chains inside route bodies are analyzed in the same
;; structural context they actually run in.
;;
;; An unknown dependency lookup keeps actual types unknown. Inventing a
;; variadic function here falsely makes request/reply and scalar TTL values
;; callable, producing type errors in valid route bodies. The hook preserves
;; checks on real literals/local values rather than disabling type analysis.
;;
;; Only symbols that actually appear in the body are injected, so
;; clj-kondo does not emit spurious unused-binding warnings for the
;; many standard deps that a given route does not reference.
;;
;; request and reply are modeled by unknown values in the same let
;; pool so clj-kondo does not flag them as unresolved inside route bodies.
;; ctx is modeled as the wrapping ^:async fn parameter (the macro binds
;; it from (aget request "ctx")), not via the let pool.
;;
;; In pre-handler mode children[5] is a vector of guard fn symbols;
;; it is detected and skipped so it is not treated as a body form.

;; Structural params (app, deps) are never in body text — generated as _-prefixed.
;; runtime and config are sometimes in body text; they go in the filtered let pool.
