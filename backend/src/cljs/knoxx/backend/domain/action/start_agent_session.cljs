  it with `:resource-policies-from-event`, because a trigger that did not ask
  must not have its agent's resource scope set by whoever emitted the event.

  The opt-in exists because a trigger contract is static while a pin is
  per-event: `law.translation-agent/TranslationNeededEvent` carries the document,
