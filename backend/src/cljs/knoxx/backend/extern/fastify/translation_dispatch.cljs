  "Fastify boundary for translation dispatch.

  Native request and reply handles are born and die here; the facade this
  adapter calls receives decoded CLJS data and returns CLJS data.

  One route lets an authorized operator dispatch whatever translation work the
  publication gate currently derives. A second, process-local route reports
  whether the exact event turns named by a deployment verifier have released
  their settlement owners. The worker's answer becoming durable evidence is
  not a route of its own: the worker already reports batch status to
  `POST /api/translations/batches/:id/status`. See `infra.routes.translation`
  for where that report is resolved."
