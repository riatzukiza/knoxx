(ns knoxx.backend.infra.translation-agent-dispatch
  "Dispatching derived translation work to an agent actor instead of a worker.

  The sibling of `infra.translation-dispatch`'s send path, and deliberately a
  sibling rather than a branch inside it. The two share everything that decides
  *whether* work happens — the gate derives it, `law.translation-dispatch` keys
  and claims it, and the completion path mints the receipt — and differ only in
  who is asked to do it. Expressed as a flag inside one function, the worker's
  ambiguous-send recovery would have had to grow a second meaning it does not
  have here.

  ## Why sending is unambiguous on this path

  `infra.translation-dispatch` carries a large amount of machinery for one
  problem: an HTTP POST that throws may still have landed, so a failed create is
  not evidence that no batch exists, and adopting or retrying it wrongly
  translates twice. Emitting an event has no such window. The dispatcher is
  in-process, the event id is derived from the run id so a re-emit is deduped
  rather than doubled, and a throw means the dispatcher did not confirm a
  successful trigger action. So a failure here is retriable, and there is no
  remote batch to observe or adopt.

  Reconciliation re-announces an accepted claim's deterministic event. The live
  dispatcher deduplicates it. After restart, an event whose run was never admitted
  can start normally; an existing run refuses adoption by a fresh invocation.
  That refusal makes the dispatch retriable, and the next reconciliation creates
  a fresh run/turn. A complete durable candidate set can still settle directly.
  Immutable old run history is never overwritten to resume an unknown owner.

  The runner's full-turn settlement callback also moves an exact claim that did
  not complete to retriable failure. That covers provider rejection, tool
  rejection, partial submission, and a successful-looking turn that simply did
  not produce the claimed complete candidate set. What remains is scheduling:
  unlike the worker path there is no internal retry timer, so the next admission
  or reconciliation performs the retry. That narrower gap is recorded rather
  than papered over — see `known-gap` below."
