  Every coordinate is optional, because `save-translation-segment` and
  `publication-translation-pair` both default all four from the session's
  `:resourcePolicies` — that fallback predates this schema and is what makes a
  pinned translation session work at all. Declaring them required contradicted
  it: the JSON-schema validator refuses the call before either handler runs, so
  an agent that correctly omitted a coordinate its session was already pinned to
  got a `must have required properties document_id` refusal, and its
  translation was thrown away. Observed live: four correct translations
  produced by the model, refused at the schema, and lost.

  Optional in the schema is not unenforced. `save-openplanner-segment!` still
  throws when `document_id` resolves blank after the policy fallback, and
  `law.translation-agent-submission/pair-refusal` still refuses a submission
  whose coordinates disagree with the pin. The check moved to where the
  defaulted value is actually known, which is the only place it can be correct."

  Deliberately built from the same `policy-value` fallbacks
  `save-translation-segment` uses, so the agent may omit any coordinate its
  session was already pinned to and the two sinks agree about what a submission
  means.

  The organization comes from the pin, NOT from
  `translation-scope/translation-org-id!`. That function negotiates a tenant
  between a *request context* and a resource policy — an ordinary membership may
  only target its own organization, and only a system principal may name
  another. A triggered session has no request context at all: `spawn-direct!`
  builds its actor from a contract rather than from an HTTP caller, so the run
  carries `org_id`, `user_email` and `membership_id` all nil. Called here it
  therefore threw `organization is required for save_translation` on every
  submission, and four correct translations were lost to it.

  Taking the pinned value is not a loosening, because the pinned value is not
  caller-supplied. `law.translation-agent/session-policies` derives it from a
  dispatch record that `reserve-dispatch!` persisted under an authenticated
  request, and `infra.translation-agent-sink/submit-pair!` re-reads that record
  by `run_id` and refuses unless its `:dispatch/key` matches the overlay. The
  receipt's `:translation/org-id` is then minted from the *stored record*, never
  from this map — so a forged overlay cannot invent a tenant, because it would
  have to also produce a stored claim that agrees with it.

  The OpenPlanner segment path is untouched and still negotiates, because it
  really does run from request contexts."
