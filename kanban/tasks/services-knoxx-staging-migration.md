# Services — knoxx staging slot on DigitalOcean

> Parent epic: `knoxx-translated-publication-to-website`
> Repository: `open-hax/services`

## Purpose

> **Superseded in part, 2026-09-16.** A testing/staging controller now exists:
> `services#83` ("Add per-service HTTPS environments and gated promotion") adds
> `.github/workflows/deploy-service-environment.yml`, which admits only
> `testing|staging` for `knoxx|axxium`. It deploys into a **shared** environment
> per service and phase, not one per pull request: the `deploy` job takes
> `environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}` verbatim and its concurrency group is
> `promethean-<service>-<environment>`, so the PR number gates admission and
> selects the source commit but does not partition the slot. It is
> **not on `main`** — the PR is open. Knoxx `main` nevertheless already calls it:
> `#306` shipped `.github/workflows/environment-promotion.yml` pinned to
> `deploy-service-environment.yml@f9bfe172`, a commit on that unmerged branch.
>
> So this card is no longer "design staging from nothing". What remains is
> reviewing and landing `services#83`, and closing the pin hazard below.

Knoxx had **no staging phase at all** when this card was written. It had one on the second deploy lane;
`services#67` removed that lane and nothing replaced the slot, so today there is
no `digitalocean/services/` definition and no hostname for it. This is a
creation, not a migration.

It is the phase the promotion rule depends on. Without it, every production
deploy of the busiest service in the constellation ships code that has run
nowhere but CI.

## Dependencies

`services-staging-slot-pattern`. Also interacts with `knoxx`'s own
`deploy-staging.yml` and the label-gated `deploy-testing.yml`, which currently
targeted the removed lane's shared staging slot.

## Work

- Apply the staging-slot pattern to `digitalocean/services/knoxx/`: phase-derived
  compose project, state path, ports, container names and `staging-` hostname.
- Knoxx is two containers plus a health dependency — the backend's `/health`
  returns 503 until Proxx is reachable and its healthcheck gates the frontend. A
  staging Knoxx therefore needs a Proxx to talk to. Decide whether it points at
  staging Proxx or production Proxx, and say why; pointing at production means
  staging traffic reaches production inference.
- Settle the data boundary. Knoxx runs the OpenPlanner data plane in-process
  against Atlas; staging must not write into production collections. This is the
  database-posture question from the pattern card, and Knoxx is where it bites.
- Repoint knoxx's own `deploy-staging.yml` at the new slot, and decide what
  `deploy-testing.yml`'s label-gated PR deploys do — it currently shares the
  staging slot by design and says so ("the slot is shared — a real staging merge
  deploy will overwrite it"). That trade may or may not survive the move.
- `verify.sh` runs unchanged against staging. The gate is phase-agnostic; if it
  is not, that is a defect in the gate.

## Definition of Done

- Knoxx staging deploys to DigitalOcean and its gate passes.
- Its inference and data dependencies are declared, with staging isolated from
  production data.
- `deploy-staging.yml` targets the new slot, and the testing slot's behavior is
  decided.
- A staging deployment record exists for the promotion check to read.
