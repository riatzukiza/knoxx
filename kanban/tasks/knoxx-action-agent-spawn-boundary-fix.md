# Fix domain/action/start-agent-session domain-to-infra boundary crossing

> Parent epic: `knoxx-events-agent-runtime-separation`

## Context

`domain/action/start_agent_session.cljs` line 5 has a direct import of `knoxx.backend.infra.agent.runner` — a domain namespace importing infra. This is the one blended-runtime pattern that remains in the action dispatch path. The action should receive a `spawn!` callable via the actor context map, not reach into the infra layer directly.

The current call site (line 129):
```clojure
(agents-runner/spawn-direct! config {...})
```

The actor context map `ctx` already carries `:config`, `:event`, `:trigger`. Adding `:spawn-agent!` to it at the infra dispatch layer lets the domain action stay pure.

## Work

1. In `domain/event/dispatch.cljs` `actor-context` function (line 79-88): add `:spawn-agent!` key pointing to `agents-runner/spawn-direct!`. This requires adding `[knoxx.backend.infra.agent.runner :as agents-runner]` to dispatch's require — which is an infra import from the domain event dispatcher. Evaluate whether the spawn fn should instead be injected at the `event-runtime` level and threaded through config, or simply added to dispatch as a seam. Document the decision in a code comment.

2. In `domain/action/start_agent_session.cljs`:
   - Remove the `[knoxx.backend.infra.agent.runner :as agents-runner]` require
   - Replace `(agents-runner/spawn-direct! config {...})` with `((:spawn-agent! ctx) config {...})`
   - Add guard: if `:spawn-agent!` is nil in ctx, throw `(js/Error. "No :spawn-agent! in action context")`

3. Update `domain/action/invoke_agent.cljs` similarly if it uses a `run-agent!` ctx key (already in ctx at line 5 — verify it does not also import infra).

## Affected files

- `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/domain/action/start_agent_session.cljs` (remove infra require, use ctx fn)
- `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/domain/event/dispatch.cljs` (add :spawn-agent! to actor-context)
- `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/domain/action/invoke_agent.cljs` (verify, may need same pattern)

## Definition of Done

- `domain/action/start_agent_session.cljs` has no import of `knoxx.backend.infra.agent.runner`
- `clj-kondo` reports no domain-to-infra boundary violations in the action namespace
- `pnpm -C backend run typecheck` exits 0
- `pnpm -C backend lint` exits 0
- Manual smoke: fire a trigger that uses `:actions/start-agent-session` via `POST /api/admin/triggers/:id/fire` and confirm an agent session spawns

Triage 2026-05-29: Freshly-split epic subtask with a concrete 3-file scope — remove the direct infra require from `domain/action/start_agent_session.cljs`, inject `:spawn-agent!` via the actor context map at the dispatch layer, and verify with clj-kondo + typecheck + smoke test. No external blockers; DoD is fully specified and workable today. Verdict: accepted (P2). --tasks-dir /home/err/devel/orgs/open-hax/openplanner/packages/agents/knoxx/kanban

HOLD completion of knoxx-action-agent-spawn-boundary-fix: the full spawn capability implementation is prepared locally, but the required zero-warning lint gate is unsatisfied. The accepted required `pnpm -C backend lint` command exits3 with8errors/288warnings; the exact accepted-sync base5670338 independently yields the same8errors/288warnings. Existing issue181 (zero-warning gate) and epic182 (lint/coverage/architecture remediation) own this dependency; no duplicate repair scope is created.

Actual guarded compiled tests1854/9152 pass with0failures/0errors and exit0; JavaScript75/75, production server typecheck0warnings/exit0 and boundarycheck pass. The private HTTP smoke proves401without admission and202with one matched trigger, actual runner/Clio run and thread admission plus active agent session; provider construction/hydration/prompt remain local fixtures. This does not qualify a paid provider or deployed authentication.

All original issue161 acceptance/checklist obligations remain. This HOLD comment does not transition the task, change its estimate or mark its checklist complete. Local card remains in_progress until an authorized lawful transition exists and all required gates qualify. Original/corrected RED and all failed preparation attempts remain append-only evidence. The captured production Discord message and voice callback tests now pass after an additional RED1test/18assertions/4failures/0errors demonstrated the missing outer-config injection. No live Discord connection was opened.
