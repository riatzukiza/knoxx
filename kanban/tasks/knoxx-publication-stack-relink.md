# Publication — relink the stranded PR stack onto main

> Parent epic: `knoxx-translated-publication-to-website`

> **Done 2026-08-21.** The whole ladder is merged to `main`:
> `#247` → `#233` → `#234` → `#235` → `#236` → `#237` → `#239` → `#240` →
> `#241` → `#243` → `#242`. Kept below as the record of what was wrong and how
> it was repaired, because the failure mode is not obvious and will recur.

## Purpose

Nine open PRs carrying the whole contract-owned publication pipeline sat above a
pull request that was closed, unmerged, and — this is the part that mattered —
**could not be reopened**. Nothing in this epic or in
`knoxx-publication-runtime-follow-up` could land until the bottom of the ladder
did.

## The state, precisely

`#230` (`feat/publication-intent-resolver`) merged to `main` and its branch was
deleted. `#232` (`feat/publication-state-migration` → `feat/publication-intent-resolver`)
is closed, unmerged, `mergeable_state: dirty`, `closed_at` 2026-08-21T17:38:55Z.

Both repair operations are refused by the API:

```text
PullRequest.base (invalid): Cannot change the base branch of a closed pull request.
PullRequest.state (custom): state cannot be changed.
                            The feat/publication-intent-resolver branch has been deleted.
```

**Do not generalize this into "GitHub closes PRs when their base is deleted."**
It does not. When a pull request merges and its head branch is deleted, GitHub
retargets open PRs that used it as a base onto the merged PR's own base — which
is exactly what should have happened here and demonstrably did not. Everything
above `#232` kept its base and stayed open; the fourteen other open PRs are fine.
What is established is the observed state and the two refusals above, not a rule
about the platform.

The rest of the ladder is intact at the branch level. `#233`'s base,
`feat/publication-state-migration`, still exists with all nine commits, which is
why this is a base problem and not lost work.

## Work

- **Done: `#247`** opens `feat/publication-state-migration` → `main`, same head
  commit, nothing rewritten. It carries `#232`'s review history by reference; that
  history is where the four fold-level findings and the answered-not-fixed entry
  point question live, and it should be read before merging.
- Verify the ladder still applies. Merged in PR order into current `main`, all
  eleven branches apply with **no conflicts** — re-run this rather than trusting
  it, since `main` moves:

  ```text
  publication-state-migration → translation-config-resource →
  translation-publication-gate → publication-reconcile-plan →
  publication-adapter-effects → publication-receipts-proof →
  cms-resource-backed-publication → openplanner-rest-retirement →
  contract-publication-e2e → publication-verification-artifact →
  fastify-null-prototype-params
  ```

- Merge in order. **The automatic retarget did not happen**: each PR's base
  branch still existed after its predecessor merged, so every one had to be
  retargeted to `main` explicitly before it could merge. Retarget, then merge,
  one at a time.
- Expect CodeRabbit to review each PR for the first time as it retargets.
  `.coderabbit.yaml` disables auto review on non-default base branches, so the
  entire stack has run without it — findings will arrive late and in bulk.
- Do not rebase or force-push anything in the ladder. Branches are stacked on
  exact history and a rewrite invalidates every one above it.
- Delete a base branch only after the PR stacked on it has been retargeted and
  confirmed.

## What actually happened

- `#247` opened `feat/publication-state-migration` → `main` and merged.
- Each remaining PR was retargeted to `main` by hand, then merged, in order.
  No conflicts at any step, matching the local rehearsal.
- `#243` (the null-prototype params fix) was merged **before** `#242` (the
  verification scripts), so `main` never carried the ladder's publication
  surface in the state where every route answered 500.
- Nine of the eleven pushes produced no deploy: the `knoxx-production`
  concurrency group holds one pending run and replaces it, so intermediate runs
  were evicted — the same queue-eviction behaviour `services/deploy-stack.yml`
  documents and narrowed its own group to avoid.

## Definition of Done

- `#232`'s content is merged to `main` via `#247`. ✔
- Every remaining PR in the ladder has a base that exists. ✔ — by explicit
  retarget, not automatically.
- The ladder is merged in order. ✔
- A process note records the observed failure and the two API refusals, without
  overstating them as platform behavior. ✔
