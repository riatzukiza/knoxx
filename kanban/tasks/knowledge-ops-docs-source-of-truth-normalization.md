# Knowledge Ops — Docs Source-of-Truth Normalization

> Source: `specs/tasks/knowledge-ops-docs-source-of-truth-normalization.md`
> Parent: `knowledge-ops-graph-memory-reconciliation.md`
> Points: 2

Date: 2026-04-05
Status: ready
Parent: `knowledge-ops-graph-memory-reconciliation.md`
Story points: 2

## Purpose

Normalize the docs so current readers stop getting conflicting stories about what Knoxx, OpenPlanner, and Graph-Weaver are today.

## Problem

The current doc set mixes:

- stale READMEs
- donor-era knowledge-ops docs
- current source/runtime behavior

This increases planning overhead and causes architectural drift in future work.

## Goals

1. Point readers at the reconciliation spec as the current-state anchor.
2. Correct obviously stale backend/runtime descriptions.
3. Make source-home vs runtime-home explicit where needed.

## Non-Goals

1. Rewriting the entire knowledge-ops corpus.
2. Perfecting product messaging.
3. Deleting historical donor material.

## Affected files

- `orgs/open-hax/knoxx/README.md`
- `orgs/open-hax/knoxx/specs/README.md`
- `orgs/open-hax/openplanner/README.md`
- `services/knoxx/README.md` as needed

## Verification

1. README-level readers land on the right current-state docs quickly.
2. Knoxx backend is no longer described as the old Python/FastAPI implementation where that is false.

## Definition of done

- The obvious current-state doc contradictions are removed or superseded.

## Breakdown

Scope is tightly bounded to README-level edits across 3-4 named files: `orgs/open-hax/knoxx/README.md`, `orgs/open-hax/knoxx/specs/README.md`, `orgs/open-hax/openplanner/README.md`, and `services/knoxx/README.md` as needed. Implementation steps: (1) add a pointer to the reconciliation spec as the current-state anchor in each file, (2) strike or correct any Python/FastAPI backend references that no longer reflect runtime, (3) annotate source-home vs runtime-home where ambiguous. No code changes, no inter-task dependencies — can be picked up immediately against main.

**Triage 2026-05-29 (incoming → accepted):** P2. 2sp score confirmed — bounded to README-level edits across 3-4 files, no implementation work. Can be picked up independently of other graph recovery tasks. Accepted.

---

**Triage 2026-05-29 (accepted → ready):** All ready-gate criteria pass. 2sp confirmed, DoD is unambiguous (remove obvious current-state contradictions), affected files are explicitly named, no hard inter-task dependency blocks the work. Promoting to ready.

HOLD: Full issue164 remains blocked on the mandatory OpenPlanner README outside the authorized Foresight direct-repository scope. Knoxx current-routing documentation only delivers the in-scope reader entrypoint; it does not complete the whole source-of-truth normalization task. The current Ready-to-Blocked transition is unsupported by the accepted Promethean FSM; existing open-hax/rheos issue4 owns direct blocker reporting. Original criteria, UUID, Ready/P2/2 metadata and historical intent remain. No full completion or new Ready qualification is claimed.

CORRECTION to the prior HOLD comment (write-id 1791397522995-0.6rx1h1rwxqppbc803ae; event kanban-knoxx-knowledge-ops-docs-source-of-truth-normalization-1791397522998): the wording that Rheos issue 4 “owns direct blocker reporting” described the request owner, not an available transition capability. Existing open-hax/rheos issue 4 requests direct obstruction-reporting transitions from unfinished stages, but that capability is not yet available; the inspected accepted Promethean FSM still does not support Ready→Blocked. This additive clarification supersedes that capability wording without replacing the original HOLD comment or event. CodeRabbit review 5447302044 findings 4211086091 and 4211086102 also prompted spacing corrections in the current evidence README and this explicit distinction in the current routing note. Full issue 164 remains blocked on its mandatory OpenPlanner README outside the authorized Foresight direct-repository scope. Knoxx current-routing documentation delivers only the in-scope reader entrypoint. All original criteria, UUID, Ready/P2/2 metadata and historical intent remain; no task transition, checklist completion, whole-task completion or new Ready qualification is claimed.
