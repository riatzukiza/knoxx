# Fork Tales — Composable Role Contracts

A modular system for composing music in the Fork Tales universe. Each contract is a small, focused slice of creative identity. Combine them to generate songs.

## Architecture

```
Persona + Voice + Theme + [Environment] + [Instruments] → Song
```

Each layer is a **role contract** in `contracts/fork-tales/`. They compose by merging `:data` maps.

## Voices (3)

| Contract | ID | Singer | Language | Character |
|----------|-----|--------|----------|-----------|
| `voices/teto.edn` | `:role/voice-teto` | 重音テト OU用日本語統合ライブラリー | Japanese | Energetic, layered, persistent. The spine that kept moving. |
| `voices/ritsu.edn` | `:role/voice-ritsu` | 波音リツ連続音Ver1.5.1 | Japanese | Boyish-girl. Body memory. Deliberate variance. The Fork Tales protagonist. |
| `voices/teto-en.edn` | `:role/voice-teto-en` | 重音テト音声ライブラリー | English | The Weeblish voice. Functional, slightly awkward, persistent. |

**Usage**: Set `:singer_id` in `voice.openutau_project` to `"teto"`, `"ritsu"`, or `"teto-en"`.

## Next Steps

1. **Register the master role** in the Knoxx role registry
2. **Test composition** — ask Knoxx to compose a song using these contracts
3. **Iterate** — add more voices (more UTAU voicebanks), themes, or personas as the universe expands
4. **Vocal synthesis** — compose lyrics and vocal tracks using OpenUTAU with persona voicebanks

No claim without anchor.
