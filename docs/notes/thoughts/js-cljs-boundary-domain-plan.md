We need to deal with these warnings, and establish a policy around writing code that prevents these from piling up.

most of these are happening because we are using inline the js/* namespace all over the place.

We need to... isolate the boundry between js stuff, and clojurescript stuff.

I think the least confusing way to do this, would...
be to classify each of these different use cases wher ewe are using js,
and create domain namespaces to bound the js types to only the specific domain where it makes sense to to reason about them in.

So, like:
- date
- object
- process
- promise
- timing 
- node
  - fs
  - http
  - path
  - url
  - child-process
- postgres
- text
- eta-mu 


that accepts cljs types, and outputs cljs types, that all handle any js->cljs and cljs->js stuff

So the rest of our domains are not always having to think about "is this an object, or a map?"

and you can just assume, unless we are INSIDE of this
