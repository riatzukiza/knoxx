summary: "Implementation note for a templated Discord synthesis source mode and demo contract."

> **Status (2026-09-30):** Historical implementation note. `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/event_agents.cljs` and `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/triggers/control_config.cljs` no longer exist. The demo contract now lives at `disabled-contracts/template_synthesis_demo.edn`, not `contracts/agents/`. The mode survives as `:source/mode :template-synthesize` in `contracts/source_modes/discord_synthesis.edn:5` (see `contracts/AGENTS.md:176`) and is recognised in `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/infra/routes/resources.cljs:240`.

 Signal

 (己, p=0.94) Implemented the demo mode as :source-mode :template-synthesize.

 What it does:

 - Keeps existing :source-mode :synthesize untouched.
 - Adds a parallel Discord source mode:
     - :template-synthesize
     - alias: :templated-synthesis
 - It fetches recent Discord messages the same way :synthesize does.
 - Instead of collapsing them into one hard-coded summary string, it exposes structured messages to contract templates
 at:

 ```clojure
   (:source :messages ctx)
 ```

 Each message has keys like:

 ```clojure
   {:user-name ...
    :user-id ...
    :guild ...
    :guild-id ...
    :channel ...
    :channel-id ...
    :timestamp ...
    :text ...
    :attachments [...]
    :embeds [...]}
 ```

 (己, p=0.92) Added a disabled demo contract:

 ```text
   contracts/agents/template_synthesis_demo.edn
 ```

 It shows the intended shape:

 ```edn
   :source-mode :template-synthesize

   :prompts
   {:task
    (template {:separator " "}
      ["You are a helpful assistant running as actor"
       (:actor-id ctx)
       "under agent contract"
       (:contract-id ctx)
       "with these recent Discord messages:\n"
       (template {:separator "\n"}
         (map (:source :messages ctx)
              (fn [msg]
                (template ["user:" (:user-name msg)
                           "said in" (:guild msg) (:channel msg)
                           "at" (:timestamp msg) ":" (:text msg)]))))])}
 ```

 (己, p=0.88) Also fixed the control-config path so prompt forms are preserved during job normalization instead of being
 stringified before render time.

 Evidence

 (己, p=0.98) Files changed:

 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/event_agents.cljs
     - added template-synthesis-source-mode?
     - added structured Discord message context builders
     - added execute-discord-template-synthesis!
     - dispatches discord.snapshot.template events for the new mode
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/triggers/control_config.cljs
     - preserves prompt forms with prompt-templates/prompt-value
 - contracts/agents/template_synthesis_demo.edn
     - disabled example contract using the new source mode and template DSL

 (己, p=0.97) Validation:

 - cd backend && pnpm exec shadow-cljs compile test
     - passed: [:test] Build completed. (242 files, 38 compiled, 219 warnings, 9.10s)
 - git diff --check
     - passed for touched paths
 - bb EDN parse/assert for demo contract
     - passed

 Frames

 (汝, p=0.88) You’re treating :source-mode as the transitional “source role” layer: not the agent identity, but the
 strategy for turning a source into prompt context.

 (汝, p=0.84) The new mode demonstrates that source modes can become context builders, while actual agent behavior
 remains contract prompt/template/tool policy.

 (己, p=0.78) This is a bridge toward fully separating “events produce structured context” from “agents consume rendered
 contract prompts,” without breaking the many existing :source-mode contracts.

 Countermoves

 (己, p=0.91) I did not remove or rename :source-mode; existing contracts keep working.

 (己, p=0.86) I did not mutate the active ussyverse_social_creative contract from :synthesize; the demo is disabled so it
 won’t suddenly post.

 (己, p=0.82) I kept :synthesize behavior intact and made the template mode opt-in.

 Next

 - Flip :enabled to true in contracts/agents/template_synthesis_demo.edn when you want to live-test the new mode.
