summary: "Design spec for actor identity, credential ownership, delegation, and secret storage in Knoxx."

> **Status (2026-09-30):** Unimplemented proposal, and the source text is truncated at the end. No `connection`/`delegation` contract kinds, `contracts/connections/` or `contracts/delegations/` exist. The validator named below is actually `backend/src/cljs/open_hax/contracts/schema.cljs` (`infer-contract-class` :504, `schema-for` :530), not `contracts/validator.cljs`. Identity binding has since moved toward Axxium (`backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/law/axxium_identity.cljs`).


 Signal

 1. Yes: the right model is not “credentials per actor” in the flat sense, but a
 μ-shaped identity system with:
     - subject-actor-id = who the action is for
     - executor-actor-id = which actor/agent is running
     - connection-owner-actor-id = whose external account/token is actually used
 2. For Knoxx, the clean design is:
     - contracts store non-secret identity/policy/default mappings
     - encrypted runtime storage stores secrets/tokens
     - tools resolve credentials from request context plus delegation rules
 3. Below is a Knoxx-native spec: design plan, Malli registry forms, and proposed
 contract shapes.

 Evidence

 1. Knoxx already distinguishes:
     - auth-context for logged-in user/session/membership
     - agent-spec :actor-id for the executing agent actor
 2. Actors are already first-class contracts loaded from contracts/actors/*.edn,
 and runtime/tooling resolves them through resolve-actor, effective-agent-contract,
 and actor-aware tool filtering.
 3. The current provider auth pattern is still mostly process-global env vars,
 which cannot express:
     - user account vs agent account
     - on-behalf-of delegation
     - per-provider defaults per actor
     - bot-token vs user-login token distinctions

 Frames

 1. Identity frame: a provider action must be resolved against three identities at
 once — subject actor, executor actor, and connection owner actor.
 2. Secret-management frame: committed contracts should never hold raw provider
 secrets; contracts should point at or describe encrypted connection records stored
 elsewhere.
 3. Runtime frame: UI requests usually have both subject and executor actors, while
 automation often has only the executor actor, so connection resolution must be
 context-sensitive.

 2. provider secret schemas for encrypted storage

         [:identifier string?]

         [:public-api-url {:optional true} string?]]

        "knoxx.connection.secret/DiscordBot"
        [:map {:closed false}
         [:bot-token string?]
         [:application-id {:optional true} string?]
         [:public-key {:optional true} string?]]

        "knoxx.connection.secret/DiscordUser"
        [:map {:closed false}
         [:access-token string?]
         [:refresh-token {:optional true} string?]
         [:token-type {:optional true} string?]
         [:scope {:optional true} string?]
         [:expires-at {:optional true} inst?]]

        "knoxx.connection.secret/TwitchUser"
        [:map {:closed false}
         [:client-id string?]
         [:client-secret string?]
         [:access-token {:optional true} string?]
         [:refresh-token {:optional true} string?]
         [:login {:optional true} string?]
         [:broadcaster-id {:optional true} string?]
         [:expires-at {:optional true} inst?]]

        "knoxx.connection.secret/TwitchApp"
        [:map {:closed false}
         [:client-id string?]
         [:client-secret string?]
         [:access-token {:optional true} string?]
         [:expires-at {:optional true} inst?]]})
   ```
 3. contract shape split
     1. Put these in contracts:
           - actor defaults
           - connection metadata without secrets
           - delegation grants
           - policy constraints
     2. Put these in encrypted storage:
           - app passwords
           - bot tokens
           - OAuth access/refresh tokens
           - token expiry/rotation internals
     3. Reason:
           - contracts remain diffable and auditable
           - secrets never land in git
           - admin UI can rotate secrets without contract churn
 4. proposed contract shapes
   ```clojure
     ;; contracts/actors/chat_primary.edn
     {:actor/id "chat_primary"
      :actor/kind :agent
      :actor/org "open-hax"
      :actor/label "Primary Chat"
      :actor/default-agent "knoxx_default"
      :actor/roles [:role/knowledge-worker]
      :actor/default-connections
      {:discord "conn_discord_bot_knoxx"
       :bluesky "conn_bluesky_chat_primary"
       :twitch "conn_twitch_chat_primary"}}

     ;; contracts/connections/conn_bluesky_chat_primary.edn
     {:connection/id "conn_bluesky_chat_primary"
      :contract/kind :connection
      :connection/provider :bluesky
      :connection/kind :bluesky/user
      :connection/owner-actor-id "chat_primary"
      :connection/label "Primary Chat Bluesky"
      :connection/enabled? true
      :connection/public
      {:identifier "chat-primary.bsky.social"
       :service-url "https://bsky.social"
       :public-api-url "https://public.api.bsky.app"}
      :connection/secret-ref
      {:secret/id "sec_conn_bluesky_chat_primary"
       :secret/backend :policy-db}}

     ;; contracts/connections/conn_discord_bot_knoxx.edn
     {:connection/id "conn_discord_bot_knoxx"
      :contract/kind :connection
      :connection/provider :discord
      :connection/kind :discord/bot
      :connection/owner-actor-id "chat_primary"
      :connection/label "Knoxx Discord Bot"
      :connection/enabled? true
      :connection/public
      {:application-id "123456789012345678"}
      :connection/secret-ref
      {:secret/id "sec_conn_discord_bot_knoxx"
       :secret/backend :policy-db}}

     ;; contracts/delegations/alice_to_chat_primary_bsky.edn
     {:delegation/id "alice_to_chat_primary_bsky"
      :contract/kind :delegation
      :delegation/from-actor-id "alice_user"
      :delegation/to-actor-id "chat_primary"
      :delegation/providers [:bluesky]
      :delegation/tool-ids ["bluesky.publish" "bluesky.profile" "bluesky.timeline"]
      :delegation/connection-kinds [:bluesky/user]
      :delegation/mode :on-behalf-of
      :delegation/enabled? true
      :delegation/notes "Allow the chat actor to post to Alice's Bluesky when
 explicitly acting on her behalf."}
   ```
 5. validator additions
     1. Extend backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/contracts/validator.cljs with:
           - ConnectionContract
           - DelegationContract
     2. Extend infer-contract-class / schema-for to recognize:
           - "connections"
           - "delegations"
     3. Extend contract loader path helpers for:
           - contracts/connections/*.edn
           - `contracts/delegation
