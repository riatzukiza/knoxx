We need to seperate the effects from the contract logic. I think I want to simplify this system for now.
Create a contract runtime namespace
define the runtime in terms of pure functions that are only handling transformation of data.
simplify the persistence to a folder full of edn files for now
The agent then won't need special tools for updating contracts.
it can just write contracts to the folder.
we can instead define the contract system to the agent in terms of a contract authoring skill graph.

The only tools it should have for the contract runtime should be for inspecting currently active actors.
we will define all sessions in terms of actors executing intents to fulfill contracts guided by policies given a set of capabilities granted to them by their role with in the context of the contract they are fulfilling

any unrecognied form in a contract is passed directly to the agent as a string, as a result,
In their simplest state, a contract is a homo-iconic prompt
