> **Status (2026-09-30):** Historical. The proposed split landed under different names. Contract semantics now live in `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/domain/contracts/` (`loader`, `resolve`, `roles`, `tools`, `sources`, `client`), with schemas in `backend/src/cljs/open_hax/contracts/schema.cljs`. `runtime/` holds only `roles.cljs` and `state.cljs`. `policy_db.cljs`, `agent_turns.cljs`, `event_agents.cljs` and `contracts_routes.cljs` are gone; see `infra/db/policy.cljs`, `infra/agent/turn.cljs` and `infra/routes/resources.cljs`. The Mongo/driver discussion was not carried out as written.


Signal

 (己, p=0.95) Your instinct is right: if the system is truly
 contract-oriented, runtime is the wrong bucket for most of
 this code.

 (己, p=0.93) I would make this split:

 - knoxx.backend.runtime.* = live process concerns only
     - runtime.config
     - runtime.state
     - maybe runtime.sdk / runtime.sessions if needed
 - knoxx.backend.contracts.* = contract system
     - contracts.loader
     - contracts.validator
     - contracts.catalog
     - contracts.resolve
     - contracts.watch
     - contracts.index
     - contracts.engine or contracts.compiler
     - contracts.drivers.{edn,mongodb,postgresql,json,yaml}

 (己, p=0.92) I would not create a top-level contract_runtime
 namespace unless it literally executes compiled contracts at
 runtime. Idiomatic CLJ here is domain-first:
 - contracts.* for contract semantics
 - runtime.* for process/runtime semantics

 (己, p=0.91) The real target architecture looks like this:

 EDN contracts -> validate -> normalize -> resolve refs ->
 compile/materialize -> serve/use everywhere

 (己, p=0.9) That means:
 - users have user contracts
 - agents have agent contracts
 - roles/capabilities/policies/models are contracts
 - auth/policy/tooling/routes consume compiled contract state
 - storage is a driver detail, not the meaning of the system

 (己, p=0.89) On storage: MongoDB is a better fit than
 PostgreSQL for the contract catalog if:
 - Malli/Malli-like validation is already your truth layer
 - contract shapes will evolve often
 - you already run Mongo
 - you want to stop doing schema duplication work

 (己, p=0.88) But the key move is not “switch SQL to Mongo.”
 The key move is “extract a contract store protocol, then swap
 drivers under it.” Do that first.

 (己, p=0.9) Concretely, I’d split your proposed namespaces
 like this:

 - top-level app domains:
     - auth
     - users
     - agents
     - routes
     - tools
     - triggers
     - memory
     - mcp
     - policy
     - voice
     - translation
     - discord
 - contract subdomain:
     - contracts.actors
     - contracts.users
     - contracts.agents
     - contracts.roles
     - contracts.capabilities
     - contracts.policies
     - contracts.models
     - contracts.loader
     - contracts.validator
     - contracts.resolve
     - contracts.drivers.*

 (己, p=0.87) I would keep actors and capabilities under
 contracts.* unless they also gain non-contract behavior.
 Otherwise you’ll just recreate the same drift one level
 higher.

 (己, p=0.91) The highest-value decompositions are:

 - policy_db.cljs
     - split into:
           - policy.catalog for static permission/tool
 definitions
           - policy.repo protocol
           - policy.drivers.postgresql
           - later policy.drivers.mongodb
           - users.provisioning or contracts.users.sync for
 actor-contract upserts
 - tooling.cljs
     - move contract resolution into contracts.resolve
     - leave tool runtime factories in tooling / tools
 - contracts_routes.cljs
     - split into:
           - routes.contracts
           - contracts.watch
           - contracts.index
 - agent_turns.cljs
     - split into:
           - agents.turns
           - agents.recovery
           - agents.policy
           - agents.streaming
           - agents.previews
 - event_agents.cljs
     - split into:
           - triggers.runtime
           - triggers.sources.discord
           - triggers.jobs
           - triggers.dispatch
           - triggers.state

 Evidence

 (己, p=0.97) runtime/config.cljs already says it is
 “intentionally env-only,” which is a clean runtime boundary.

 (己, p=0.97) runtime/state.cljs is basically just mutable
 process state (config*), which also fits true runtime
 semantics.

 (己, p=0.96) runtime/contract_loader.cljs,
 runtime/contract_validator.cljs, and runtime/roles.cljs are
 not runtime concerns; they are contract catalog / validation /
 resolution concerns.

 (己, p=0.95) tooling.cljs currently resolves actors, agent
 contracts, roles, capabilities, and effective tool policies.
 That is contract interpretation logic, not generic tooling
 logic.

 (己, p=0.96) policy_db.cljs is the clearest drift signal: its
 docstring says PostgreSQL policy DB, but it also contains
 contract-dir discovery, EDN reading, and user actor contract
 upsert helpers. That means persistence, policy semantics, and
 contract projection are mixed together.

 (己, p=0.95) contracts_routes.cljs mixes HTTP handlers, file
 watching, Redis indexing, and event-agent reload behavior.
 That should be at least three layers, not one.

 (己, p=0.94) The backend already partially wants domain
 separation:
 - existing dirs: auth, routes, tools, triggers, users
 - huge files still sitting at root:
     - policy_db.cljs 113214 bytes
     - agent_turns.cljs 84753
     - app_routes.cljs 74938
     - event_agents.cljs 49200

 (己, p=0.93) The large function sizes reinforce the same
 story:
 - create-policy-db at line 2118 in policy_db.cljs
 - send-agent-turn! at line 646 in agent_turns.cljs
 - resume-recovered-session! at line 1223 in agent_turns.cljs

 Frames

 (己, p=0.84) Frame 1: this is mostly a naming problem.
 - If so, renaming runtime to contracts and moving a few files
 will buy a lot of clarity fast.

 (己, p=0.88) Frame 2: this is really a boundary problem.
 - The deeper issue is that contract loading, policy
 enforcement, actor resolution, persistence, and routes are
 entangled. Renaming alone will help, but not fix drift.

 (己, p=0.82) Frame 3: this is a source-of-truth problem.
 - If EDN contracts are meant to do the work, then DBs should
 become projections/caches/materializations of contract state,
 not peer sources of truth.

 Countermoves

 (己, p=0.93) Do not migrate from PostgreSQL to MongoDB by
 rewriting policy_db.cljs in place. First extract a protocol,
 keep the PG driver, then add a Mongo driver.

 (己, p=0.91) Do not let “driver system” mean “every backend is
 equally canonical.” Pick one source-of-truth model:
 - best fit here: EDN contracts canonical, DBs are
 projections/materializations

 (己, p=0.9) Do not put actors, roles, capabilities, and
 policies into unrelated top-level namespaces unless they have
 app behavior independent of contracts. Otherwise you weaken
 the contract-oriented center.

 (己, p=0.89) Do not keep contract resolution in tooling.cljs.
 That guarantees future policy and agent logic keeps leaking
 into tool code.

 (己, p=0.88) Do not try to break up app_routes.cljs first. The
 safer first seam is the contract subsystem, because it already
 has identifiable files and clearer domain edges.

 Next

 (己, p=0.95) Write a short
 docs/contract-oriented-backend-refactor.md that defines one
 boundary in one sentence: “knoxx.backend.contracts.* owns
 loading, validating, resolving, compiling, and storing
 contracts; knoxx.backend.runtime.* owns live process state
 only.”
