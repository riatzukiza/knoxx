> **Status (2026-09-30):** Historical snapshot, and the title does not match the body, which is about multimodal model input rather than contract kinds. Paths have moved. Contracts live in `contracts/`, not `backend/contracts/`. `agent_hydration.cljs` is now `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/infra/agent/hydration.cljs` (`build-agent-multimodal-message` :168). `openplanner_memory.cljs` is now `infra/openplanner/memory.cljs`. `stored-session-message->agent-message` is now in `infra/agent/message.cljs:6`. The facts have moved too. Several models now declare `[:text :image]` or `[:text :image :audio]` (e.g. `contracts/models/gemma4_31b.edn:12`, `contracts/models/gpt_5.edn:11`, `contracts/model_families/gemma4.edn:10`). `planner-row->agent-message` now restores image `content_parts` (`infra/openplanner/memory.cljs:136-160`).

 Signal

 (世, p=0.98) Short answer: not in the way the contracts
 currently imply.

 (世, p=0.98) Today Knoxx has four different things that are
 easy to confuse:
 - model input capability
 - upload/attachment tools
 - frontend rendering
 - session persistence/rehydration

 (世, p=0.99) They are not the same thing.

 (世, p=0.98) Current state:
 - images/audio/video/documents can be uploaded and rendered in
 the UI
 - workspace_media.attach can attach workspace files for the
 user to see/play in Knoxx
 - but the model contracts currently declare your shipped
 models as [:text] only
 - and session rehydration currently strips multimodal content
 back to text

 (世, p=0.97) So if your question is:
 “Can Knoxx agents actually perceive attached media as model
 input across turns?”
 the answer is:

 - images: not reliably in the current Knoxx contract/runtime
 setup
 - audio: no verified support in the current SDK/model contract
 surface
 - video/documents: no verified support as model input
 - persistence between turns: no, not currently

 Evidence

 (世, p=0.99) cap_multimodal.edn is only:

 ```edn
   {:cap/id :cap/multimodal
    :cap/tools [:multimodal.upload]}
 ```

 (世, p=0.99) That means cap_multimodal is a tool capability,
 not a model-perception capability.

 (世, p=0.98) Your model-family and model contracts currently
 declare both shipped models as text-only:

 backend/contracts/model_families/gemma4.edn

 ```edn
   :model-family/input [:text]
 ```

 backend/contracts/model_families/glm_5.edn

 ```edn
   :model-family/input [:text]
 ```

 backend/contracts/models/gemma4_31b.edn

 ```edn
   :model/input [:text]
 ```

 backend/contracts/models/glm_5.edn

 ```edn
   :model/input [:text]
 ```

 (世, p=0.97) Knoxx does load these input declarations into
 runtime model config in:
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/runtime/models.cljs

 It maps :model-family/input / :model/input into provider model
 config :input.

 (世, p=0.98) The upstream pi/coding-agent type surface only
 clearly supports text + image for user/model context, not
 audio/video/document:

 From
 orgs/badlogic/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/docs/session.md:

 ```ts
   interface UserMessage {
     role: "user";
     content: string | (TextContent | ImageContent)[];
   }
 ```

 and ToolResultMessage is:

 ```ts
   content: (TextContent | ImageContent)[]
 ```

 (世, p=0.97) The public SDK docs also only document image
 multimodality, e.g.:
 docs/sdk.md

 ```ts
   await session.prompt("What's in this image?", {
     images: [{ type: "image", source: { ... } }]
   });
 ```

 (世, p=0.98) So the current verified model-input story is:
 - text: yes
 - image: potentially yes, if model/provider contract says so
 - audio/video/document: not established by the SDK type
 surface you are building on

 (世, p=0.97) Knoxx’s own build-agent-multimodal-message
 currently constructs:
 - {:type "image"...}
 - {:type "audio"...}
 - {:type "video"...}
 - {:type "document"...}

 in backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/agent_hydration.cljs.

 But (世, p=0.95) that is aspirational code unless the
 underlying SDK/provider actually accepts those blocks. The
 typed SDK/docs you have only clearly promise image support.

 (世, p=0.99) workspace_media.attach as currently implemented
 does not add the media into model context. It returns:
 - text in content
 - media payload in details.content_parts

 That means:
 - the user sees the attachment in the Knoxx UI
 - the model gets the textual summary, not the actual
 image/audio bytes as tool-result context

 (世, p=0.98) Session persistence between turns is currently
 text-only on rehydration:

 backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/agent_runtime.cljs

 ```clj
   (defn stored-session-message->agent-message
     [message]
     ...
     #js {:role role
          :content #js [#js {:type "text" :text content}]
          ...})
 ```

 backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/openplanner_memory.cljs

 ```clj
   (defn planner-row->agent-message
     [row]
     ...
     #js {:role role
          :content #js [#js {:type "text" :text text}]
          ...})
 ```

 (世, p=0.99) So even if a multimodal item exists in the
 original turn, current rehydration does not restore it as
 multimodal context for subsequent turns.

 (世, p=0.97) Also, attachment payloads are intentionally
 stripped before long-term indexing:
 - sanitize-tool-receipt-for-indexing removes :content_parts
 in openplanner_memory.cljs

 That is good for memory size/safety, but it also means the raw
 attachment does not persist in OpenPlanner session memory.

 Frames

 (己, p=0.91) Frame 1: cap_multimodal currently means “you may
 use upload tooling,” not “the model is multimodal.”

 (己, p=0.9) Frame 2: Knoxx frontend multimodal UX is ahead of
 Knoxx model-capability truth. The UI can show more media than
 the model can necessarily understand.

 (己, p=0.88) Frame 3: workspace_media.attach is currently a
 presentation tool, not a perception tool.

 Countermoves

 (世, p=0.98) If you want the contracts under model_families/
 and models/ to describe reality, I would recommend:

 - keep :input [:text] for models unless you have verified
 image support end-to-end
 - only mark a model [:text :image] after live testing proves
 the model can answer about attached images in Knoxx
 - do not claim audio/video/document model input support yet

 (世, p=0.97) If you want true image perception in Knoxx:
 - update the relevant model family/model contracts to [:text
 :image]
 - ensure the provider model config exposes that
 - test a live image prompt through Knoxx end-to-end
 - verify the model response changes based on the image, not
 just the text prompt

 (世, p=0.96) If you want tool-added images to become
 model-visible context:
 - workspace_media.attach must return image blocks in tool
 result content, not only in details
 - and only for image content, because the SDK tool-result type
 surface clearly supports images, not audio/video/documents

 (世, p=0.96) If you want multimodal context to persist between
 turns:
 - extend stored-session-message->agent-message to restore
 saved image parts
 - extend planner-row->agent-message similarly
 - persist multimodal message parts in Redis session state and
 in whatever OpenPlanner session representation you want to
 preserve
 - decide explicitly whether you want heavy binary payloads in
 session history, or only references/URLs

 (世, p=0.95) For audio specifically, the safer near-term
 design is:
 - treat audio as a file/tool artifact for the user
 - transcribe it first if you want model reasoning over it
 - only then feed the transcription as text context

 Next

 (汝, p=0.98) I should patch Knoxx so image-capable models are
 explicitly declared as [:text :image] only when verified, and
 make image attachments persist and rehydrate as model-visible
 context across turns.
