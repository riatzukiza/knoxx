> **Status (2026-09-30): historical.** Copy of a May 2026 chat receipt from the pre-extraction `openplanner/packages/agents/knoxx` checkout; that receipt (`dod event-agent-explicit-error-diagnostics-and-tool-merge`) is not in this repository's `receipts.edn`. The named files moved or were removed: `event_agents.cljs` and `triggers/control_config.cljs` no longer exist as cited (`infra/control_config.cljs` and `infra/agent/runner.cljs` do), `lastErrorDetail` no longer occurs in `backend/src/cljs`, and the additive role + capability + explicit tool merge now lives in `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/domain/contracts/resolve.cljs:366`.

 Signal

 (己, p=0.98) Agreed: :data/tools must not override composed role/capability tools. I patched the fallback path so
 explicit contract-local tools merge with role-derived tools instead of replacing them.

 (己, p=0.96) I also added explicit event-agent error diagnostics so failures are no longer just:

 ```text
   Cannot read properties of null (reading 'then')
 ```

 They now persist and log structured detail:

 - :lastError
 - :lastErrorDetail
 - :lastErrorStack
 - JSON diagnostic context:
     - phase
     - job id/name
     - contract source
     - source kind/mode
     - trigger kind
     - event id/kind/kinds
     - channel/message/author/guild/repository when available
     - error name/message/stack/cause/ex-data when available

 (己, p=0.95) Changed files:

 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/triggers/control_config.cljs
     - :data/tools is now additive:
       ```clojure
         (concat role-tool-ids explicit)
       ```
       not:
       ```clojure
         (if (seq explicit) explicit role-tool-ids)
       ```
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/event_agents.cljs
     - event-agent job failures now record structured error detail in runtime state and emit stackful logs.
     - dispatch/manual-run catches now call error-diagnostic.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/agents/runner.cljs
     - async direct-spawn failures now log structured JSON + stack instead of just dumping the raw error object.

 (己, p=0.91) I did not restart Knoxx/PM2, per repo rule.

 Evidence

 (己, p=0.98) Build validation passed:

 ```text
   cd backend && pnpm exec shadow-cljs compile test
   EXIT:0
 ```

 (己, p=0.86) Targeted clj-kondo remains nonzero, but on the existing dirty workspace it reports pre-existing unresolved
 symbols/size rules across these files; no compile failure was introduced.

 (己, p=0.94) Receipt appended:

 ```text
   receipts.edn
   dod=event-agent-explicit-error-diagnostics-and-tool-merge
 ```

 Frames

 (汝, p=0.93) You’re protecting the contract system’s composition model: contracts should assemble behavior from
 roles/capabilities, not become giant one-file agent definitions.

 (汝, p=0.88) The logging pain is not just “more logs”; it’s that errors lose causal context between event matching,
 action dispatch, direct spawn, and async turn execution.

 (己, p=0.82) The previous :data/tools behavior created a bad precedent because a small local field silently changed the
 whole tool authorization surface.

 Countermoves

 (己, p=0.9) This does not make :data/tools a recommended pattern; it only makes it safe/additive when present.

 (己, p=0.88) This does not solve every swallowed async failure in the whole system, but it covers the event-agent
 dispatch path and the async direct-spawn catch path that can hide later turn failures.

 (己, p=0.84) Live runtime may still be using stale compiled/hot-loaded code until the existing dev watcher reloads it or
 you approve a PM2 restart.

 Next

 (汝, p=0.9) Trigger one failing event-agent job once and inspect /api/admin/config/event-agents for
 lastErrorDetail/lastErrorStack.
