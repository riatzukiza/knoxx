> **Update 2026-09-30:** The PM2 host wiring no longer lives in this repository.
> Root `ecosystem.config.cjs:1-30` is a deprecated shim that throws unless
> `KNOXX_HOST_ECOSYSTEM_CONFIG` points at the host config (documented as
> `services/openplanner/ecosystem.host.config.cjs`, not present in this checkout,
> so the live PM2 process names are unverified here). The in-repo template
> `backend/ecosystem.dev.example.cjs:19-35` names the processes
> `knoxx-shadow-watch` (`pnpm exec shadow-cljs --source-maps watch server-dev`) and
> `knoxx-backend-dev`, and starts the backend through
> `nbb scripts/start-server-dev.cljs`, which waits for and imports
> `dist-dev/server.js` (`backend/scripts/start-server-dev.cljs:15`);
> `node dist-dev/server.js` remains available as `pnpm start:dev:direct`
> (`backend/package.json:14`). nREPL port `4500` is confirmed at
> `backend/shadow-cljs.edn:6`; `9630` is shadow-cljs's default server port (no
> override in `shadow-cljs.edn`). `knoxx-shadow` / `knoxx-backend` below are the
> names used at the time of writing.

## Signal

`shadow-cljs watch` is the compiler/control plane; it is not sufficient by itself to prove the Knoxx backend runtime is hot-reload-connected.

For the current ESM backend dev loop, Knoxx needs:

1. a shadow JVM watching `:server-dev`, and
2. a separate Node process loading `dist-dev/server.js`.

The Node process must successfully connect back to the shadow websocket. The canonical health check is:

```clojure
(require '[shadow.cljs.devtools.api :as shadow])
(shadow/repl-runtimes :server-dev)
;; healthy => non-empty
```

## Current architecture

- `:server-dev`
  - output: `backend/dist-dev/**`
  - PM2 shadow command: `pnpm exec shadow-cljs --source-maps watch server-dev`
  - PM2 backend command: `node --enable-source-maps dist-dev/server.js`
  - includes devtools/autoload hooks for hot reload
- `:server`
  - output: `backend/dist/**`
  - used by `pnpm typecheck` / `shadow-cljs compile server` and `pnpm build` / `shadow-cljs release server`
  - not the PM2 dev runtime path

## Evidence pattern for a broken loop

A broken loop usually looks like one or more of these:

- `(shadow/repl-runtimes :server-dev)` returns `[]`.
- The backend was restarted from `dist/server.js` instead of `dist-dev/server.js`.
- PM2 logs show websocket disconnects, `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9630`, stale output, or unexpected websocket responses.
- A verification compile overwrote `dist/server.js`, and PM2 was still pointed at `dist/server.js`.

## Countermoves

- Do not enable PM2 file watch on `knoxx-backend`.
- Do not point PM2 dev runtime at `dist/server.js`.
- Do not treat a successful `shadow-cljs compile server` as proof that the live runtime is connected.
- Do not use `node-repl` as the backend runtime; it is useful for scratch evaluation, not the app process.

## Recovery

1. Ensure `knoxx-shadow` is watching `server-dev`.
2. Ensure `backend/dist-dev/server.js` exists and imports the shadow Node ESM devtools client.
3. Restart `knoxx-backend` from `dist-dev/server.js`.
4. Re-check `(shadow/repl-runtimes :server-dev)`.
