> **Status (2026-09-30): historical — resolved.** `disable-cron-jobs` no longer exists anywhere in `backend/src/cljs`; `reset-runtime!` is now `(reload! config)` in `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/infra/event_runtime.cljs:90-94`. The route `register-events-runtime-reset-route!` survives at `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/infra/routes/tools.cljs:448` and the frontend still posts to `/api/admin/config/events/runtime/reset` (`frontend/src/lib/api/admin.ts:559`). The file paths below (`event_agents.cljs`, `routes/tools.cljs`, `events/runtime.cljs`) predate the `infra/` restructure.


Every time I reset the contract runtime... several contracts just get
disabled, despite their contract files saying they are enabled... WHere is
this behavior coming from?

---

Signal

 (己, p=0.97) This behavior is coming from the backend reset path. It is
 intentional code, not the contract files.

 (己, p=0.96) The reset flow does this:

 ```clojure
   (defn reset-runtime!
     [config]
     (let [live-config (or @runtime-state/config* config)
           ...
           reset-control (-> (control-config/default-event-agent-control
 live-config)
                             disable-cron-jobs)
           ...]
 ```

 Then disable-cron-jobs does this:

 ```clojure
   (defn- disable-cron-jobs
     [control]
     (update control :jobs
             (fn [jobs]
               (mapv (fn [job]
                       (if (= "cron" (get-in job [:trigger :kind]))
                         (assoc job :enabled false)
                         job))
                     (or jobs [])))))
 ```

 So every reset takes the contract-derived default control, then forcibly sets
 every cron-triggered job to :enabled false.

 (己, p=0.94) Worse: reset then persists that mutated runtime control:

 ```clojure
   (control-config/persist-event-agent-control! reset-control)
 ```

 So the persisted event runtime override says “disabled,” even if the contract
 file still says enabled.

 Evidence

 (己, p=0.98) Source path:

 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/event_agents.cljs

 (己, p=0.96) Relevant functions:

 - disable-cron-jobs
 - reset-runtime!

 (己, p=0.94) API path from the UI:

 - Frontend calls resetEventAgentRuntime
 - frontend/src/lib/api/admin.ts
 - Endpoint: POST /api/admin/config/events/runtime/reset

 (己, p=0.94) Backend route:

 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/routes/tools.cljs
 - register-events-runtime-reset-route!
 - Calls:

 ```clojure
   (events-runtime/reset-runtime! config)
 ```

 (己, p=0.93) Wrapper:

 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/events/runtime.cljs
 - Delegates to:

 ```clojure
   (legacy-event-runtime/reset-runtime! config)
 ```

 which is knoxx.backend.event-agents/reset-runtime!.

 Frames

 (汝, p=0.93) You are seeing a runtime override layer winning over the
 contract source of truth.

 (汝, p=0.9) “Several contracts” means probably the contracts whose runtime
 jobs normalize to :trigger {:kind "cron" ...}. Non-cron jobs should not be
 disabled by this function.

 (汝, p=0.86) The contract files are not lying; reset is mutating the runtime
 control plane after reading those contracts.

 Countermoves

 (己, p=0.92) This is not coming from the /agents UI rewrite directly; the UI
 only exposes the existing reset endpoint.

 (己, p=0.9) This is not caused by contract validation or EDN save behavior.

 (己, p=0.88) The old UI even hinted at this: the reset title/message said it
 disables cron jobs, but that behavior is too surprising if contracts are
 meant to be source-of-truth.

 Next

 Patch reset-runtime! to stop applying disable-cron-jobs during normal reset,
 or split it into a separate explicit “reset and disable schedules” action.

Other issues with the latest changes:
- contract identity is never populated when a contract is selected
- The runtime section has 2 levels of scrolling, it isn't a top level form like the top agents section is
