 Signal

 Implemented contract-level context overflow handling for Knoxx agent sessions.

 Agents can now declare:

 ```clojure
   :context {:max-messages 40
             :max-chars 80000
             :preserve-system true}
 ```

 The runtime applies this as deterministic sliding-window pruning so long-running/sticky
 sessions stop growing unboundedly.

 Evidence

 Changed:

 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/agent_runtime.cljs
     - Added prune-session-messages.
     - Applies policy during session rehydration.
     - Preserves system messages by default.
     - Supports:
           - :max-messages
           - :max-chars
           - :preserve-system
           - legacy/camel/snake aliases.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/agents/turn.cljs
     - Prunes seeded context before prompt.
     - Prunes request transcript before storing running session.
     - Prunes final success/failure transcripts before persistence.
     - Includes :contextPolicy in run metadata.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/contracts/resolve.cljs
     - Carries top-level :context / :context-policy from resolved agent contracts into
 agent-spec.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/app_shapes.cljs
     - Allows direct-start/request-provided agent specs to include context policy.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/contracts/validator.cljs
     - Added ContextPolicy schema and optional :context / :context-policy keys for agent
 contracts.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/routes/app.cljs
     - Preserves resolved :context-policy when building merged agent specs.
 - contracts/agents.md
     - Documented the new contract clause and behavior.
 - contracts/agents/discord/discord_voice_companion.edn
     - Added a concrete policy for the sticky voice companion session:

 ```clojure
   :context {:max-messages 80
             :max-chars 100000
             :preserve-system true}
 ```

 Validation run:

 - cd backend && npm run typecheck → EXIT=0
 - EDN parse check for contracts/agents/discord/discord_voice_companion.edn → ok
 - Targeted clj-kondo was run; it still exits nonzero due pre-existing namespace/function-size
 and route unresolved-symbol lint issues, but the new unresolved _agent-spec issue was fixed.

 Frames

 Behavior is intentionally not summarization yet.

 It is:

 - deterministic
 - contract-driven
 - applied at runtime boundaries
 - safe for system prompts by default
 - compatible with current resolved-contract flow and direct-start flow

 Pruning order:

 1. If no policy exists, transcript order and contents are unchanged.
 2. If :preserve-system is not false, all system messages are kept.
 3. Body messages are reduced to newest :max-messages.
 4. Then body messages are reduced to fit approximate :max-chars, retaining at least the newest
 body message.

 Countermoves

 Known caveats:

 - :max-chars is approximate and text-oriented; it does not treat base64 media size as full
 context text.
 - This does not generate summaries of old context. If an agent needs older facts, add a
 separate memory/summarization policy later.
 - The repo already has substantial dirty state from the prior voice/STT/event-agent work; I did
 not clean unrelated changes.
 - Targeted lint remains blocked by existing repo lint policy failures, though typecheck passes.

 Next

 Recommended next steps:

 1. Reload/restart Knoxx backend so contract resolver/runtime pick up :context.
 2. Exercise a sticky session, especially discord_voice_companion, long enough to exceed
 :max-messages.
 3. Inspect Redis/session transcript and confirm older non-system messages are pruned while
 system messages remain.
 4. If you want smarter retention, add a second contract clause later, e.g. :context {:strategy
 :summarize-then-prune ...} rather than changing this deterministic baseline.
