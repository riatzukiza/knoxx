 Signal

 Implemented actors.send-message as a first-class Knoxx tool.

 It can now deliver actor-to-actor messages through:

 - mode=follow-up / mode=message → /api/knoxx/follow-up
 - mode=steer → /api/knoxx/steer
 - mode=event → /api/admin/config/events/dispatch with eventKind=actors.message

 It supports targets like:

 - parent
 - self
 - conversation:<id>
 - session:<id>
 - actor:<id>

 Evidence

 Changed files:

 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/tools/actors.cljs
     - New vertical domain tool namespace.
     - Adds actors.send-message.
     - Resolves current/parent/session/conversation targets.
     - Sends steer, follow-up, or event delivery.
     - Accepts metadata_json for lineage labels.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/agent_hydration.cljs
     - Wires actor tools into the Knoxx custom tool suite.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/tools/registry.cljs
     - Registers actors.send-message.
 - contracts/capabilities/agent-dispatch.edn
 - contracts/capabilities/cap_event_agents.edn
     - Grants actors.send-message to agent-dispatch/event-agent capability surfaces.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/app_shapes.cljs
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/agent_runtime.cljs
     - Live steer/follow-up controls now carry metadata into queued/failed audit events.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/agent_context.cljs
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/agents/turn.cljs
     - Current agent context now includes agent-spec, letting tools resolve parent lineage.
 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/actions/invoke_sub_agent.cljs
     - Sub-agent specs now preserve parentConversationId, parentSessionId, and parentRunId when available.
 - Tests updated:
     - backend/test/cljs/knoxx/backend/actions/invoke_sub_agent_test.cljs
     - backend/test/cljs/knoxx/backend/tools/registry_test.cljs

 Validation:

 - cd backend && npm run typecheck passed, with existing warnings.
 - cd backend && npm test passed:
     - 228 tests
     - 546 assertions

 Frames

 1. This is a practical mailbox precursor: it does not build a durable mailbox table yet, but it gives child agents a
 first-class auditable delivery primitive.
 2. For live actor sessions, the clean routing path is now steer/follow-up, with lineage attached to control events
 rather than hidden in free text.
 3. For non-live or abstract actors, mode=event gives a queueable actor-message event that the event-agent runtime can
 inspect or react to later.

 Countermoves

 Remaining limits:

 - target=parent only resolves cleanly when parent conversation/session lineage is present in the agent context,
 sub-agent spec, or metadata_json.
 - actor:<id> currently emits best as mode=event; there is not yet a durable actor-id-to-live-session routing table.
 - This adds message delivery and audit metadata, not a full mailbox with delivery retries/status transitions.

 Also note: frontend/src/pages/BroadcastStudioPage.tsx was already dirty and was not touched.

 Next

 - Add a durable actor mailbox store with delivery status, retries, and actor-id-to-session resolution.


 yes let's do it... how do we want to do that though... cause... openplanner's already got "events"... we already store
 every message sent to any session... what else is there? just the delivery status and meta data right?


 Signal

 Yes — if OpenPlanner already stores the canonical event/message history, the mailbox should not become another message
 store.

 The mailbox should be a delivery ledger/projection over existing events:

 - Addressing: who/what is this for?
 - Delivery intent: steer, follow-up, event, inbox-only, maybe direct-run later
 - Delivery state: pending, delivered, failed, expired, superseded, acknowledged
 - Routing metadata: target actor/session/conversation/run/lineage
 - Retry/visibility policy: when to retry, whether a busy target should queue or drop
 - Audit pointers: links back to OpenPlanner/session/run/tool events

 So the “new thing” is not content persistence. It is delivery state plus routing semantics.

 Evidence

 The existing system already has most of the raw substrate:

 - Agent turns/session messages are stored.
 - Tool events and run events are audited.
 - events.dispatch already gives a generalized event stream.
 - actors.send-message now gives a first-class send primitive.
 - Steer/follow-up already express two delivery behaviors.
 - Sub-agent lineage now has parent run/session/conversation metadata.

 What is missing is the layer that can answer:

 - Was this message intended for actor X?
 - Has actor X seen it?
 - Was delivery attempted?
 - Did it fail because the session was busy/inactive/missing?
 - Should it be retried or converted into a follow-up?
 - Which parent/child run caused it?
 - Is this still pending work for that actor?

 That is mailbox state, not canonical conversation memory.

 Frames

 1. Mailbox as projection: OpenPlanner/events remain source of truth; mailbox is a queryable delivery-status index
 derived from actor-message events.
 2. Mailbox as queue: the mailbox owns pending work and retry decisions, while OpenPlanner remains the long-term
 immutable audit log.
 3. Mailbox as actor runtime affordance: it is less about storage and more about letting agents address each other
 without knowing whether the target is live, idle, or only inspectable later.

 Countermoves

 I would avoid creating a parallel “messages” table with full content unless there is a strong latency or retention
 reason. That risks divergence from the existing event/session store.

 A clean shape is probably:

 ```clojure
   {:mailbox/id "uuid"
    :mailbox/kind :actor-message
    :mailbox/status :pending
    :mailbox/source {:actor-id "audio_agent"
                     :session-id "..."
                     :conversation-id "..."
                     :run-id "..."}
    :mailbox/target {:kind :parent
                     :actor-id "..."
                     :session-id "..."
                     :conversation-id "..."}
    :mailbox/delivery {:mode :follow-up
                       :attempts 0
                       :next-at "..."}
    :mailbox/content-ref {:event-id "..."
                          :session-message-id "..."
                          :run-event-id "..."}
    :mailbox/metadata {:parentRunId "..."
                       :subAgentId "audio_agent"
                       :resultKey "analysis"}}
 ```

 The key is content-ref, not duplicated content. If denormalized preview text is useful for UI, store only a short
 preview/hash.

 Next

 - Define a mailbox projection schema that stores delivery state and references existing OpenPlanner/session/run events
 instead of duplicating message content.
