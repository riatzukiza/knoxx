 Signal

 Not yet as a clean first-class actor mailbox.

 Fire-and-forget sub-agents are now real independent agent runs, but they currently communicate mostly through the same
 channels any normal Knoxx agent can use: audit logs, OpenPlanner memory, Discord/tools, events, spawned child runs, and
 explicit runtime endpoints if something external calls them.

 They do not yet have a dedicated “send message to parent/sibling actor” tool.

 Evidence

 - Fire-and-forget sub-agent behavior:
     - Parent invokes :invoke/sub-agent.
     - Child run is queued with its own session/run/job identity.
     - Parent does not wait for the child answer.
     - Child proceeds as a normal Knoxx agent turn.
 - Existing communication paths:
     - A child can write/publish through tools it is allowed to use, such as Discord tools, memory/search/write-style
 tools, events dispatch, or agent-spawn tools.
     - The backend already has runtime concepts for active sessions, steering, follow-up, active run status, run events,
 and audit traces.
     - Event-agent code already uses steer/follow-up internally when a sticky session is busy.
 - Missing first-class piece:
     - There is not currently a clean tool like agents.message, agents.steer, or actors.send exposed to spawned agents
 for “message my parent”, “queue a follow-up to this actor”, or “steer that sibling session”.

 Frames

 - Fire-and-forget sub-agents are asynchronous workers, not callback functions; they can finish later and be inspected
 through audit/memory, but the parent does not automatically receive their answer.
 - Steering/follow-up exists as a runtime behavior, but it is not yet elevated into an actor-to-actor messaging API for
 sub-agents to call directly.
 - The actor model wants a mailbox layer: agents should address each other by actor/session/lineage, send messages, queue
 follow-ups, and leave receipts without requiring the parent to block.

 Countermoves

 What can happen today:

 1. A spawned agent can post to Discord or another external surface if its tool suite allows it.
 2. A spawned agent can dispatch events if it has events.dispatch or event_agents.dispatch.
 3. A spawned agent can spawn another normal agent run if it has agents.spawn.
 4. An operator/backend can steer or follow up an active session if it knows the target conversation/session ID.

 What cannot happen cleanly yet:

 1. A fire-and-forget child cannot automatically “return” a value to the parent.
 2. A child does not currently have a first-class send message to parent tool.
 3. A child does not currently have a first-class queue follow-up to sibling/parent actor tool.
 4. Parent/child message passing is not yet represented as a proper mailbox with delivery status, audit labels, and
 lineage.

 The shape I’d add next is probably:

 ```clojure
   :actors.send-message
 ```

 with parameters like:

 ```json
   {
     "target": "parent | actor-id | session-id | conversation-id",
     "mode": "message | steer | follow-up | event",
     "content": "...",
     "metadata": {
       "parentRunId": "...",
       "subAgentId": "audio_agent"
     }
   }
 ```

 Then fire-and-forget agents could report progress/results without blocking the parent, and busy targets could receive
 queued follow-ups instead of dropped or rejected turns.

 Next

 - Add a first-class actors.send-message tool that can route child-agent messages to parent/sibling sessions as steer or
 queued follow-up while preserving audit lineage.
