> **Status (2026-09-30): historical — partially realized.** Shoedelussy MCP tools now include `mcp.shoedelussy.render_loop` and `mcp.shoedelussy.render_wav` (browser-side export, not a headless server renderer; `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/infra/registry/tools.cljs:127-128`), and `backend/scripts/shoedelussy-capture-wav.mjs` captures WAV with Playwright Chromium.

EXCELLENT!!!! Now I want to have a tool in the MCP server that can render the audio from this.
I THINK we got started on this using a headless playwright browser button
the frontend needs a render audio button. That should simplify making the headless browser work.
Have it do a seperate audio thing that isn't directed to the speakers, for a single turn of the audio loop and make a wav from that
with the browser's audio api
