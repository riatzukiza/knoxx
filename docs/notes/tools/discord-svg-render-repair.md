> **Status (2026-09-30): historical.** `@resvg/resvg-js` is no longer used by the backend; SVG rendering now goes through Puppeteer (`backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/infra/svg_render.cljs`, `puppeteer-core`). `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/tools/discord.cljs` is gone; `sanitize-svg-content` lives in `backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/domain/text.cljs:7` and is required by `domain/discord/tools.cljs:10`. The `Graphics/` directory cited as evidence is not in this repository.

 Signal

 This does not look like the SVG renderer creating the <<svgsvg corruption.

 It looks like agents/models are sometimes generating the duplicated-tag pattern directly, and the Discord outbound path
 was letting those malformed SVGs through in at least one case.

 I patched the Discord SVG render path so it now runs the existing SVG repair function before passing SVG text to
 @resvg/resvg-js.

 Evidence

 I found existing broken SVGs in the repo with the exact pattern:

 - Graphics/Symmetry_Verified_Pure_Seal.svg
 - Graphics/Symmetry_Restored_BrainFart_Seal.svg
 - Graphics/Cognitive_Collapse_Certificate.svg

 The known-good SVG rendered fine with resvg; the broken one failed immediately:

 - Graphics/Symmetry_Gap_Seal.svg rendered OK.
 - Graphics/Symmetry_Verified_Pure_Seal.svg failed with invalid XML/tag parsing.
 - After applying the existing sanitize-svg-content repair, the same broken SVG rendered OK.

 The missing wire was here:

 - backend/src/cljs/knoxx/backend/tools/discord.cljs

 Before this patch, Discord rendering did:

 ```clojure
   svg-str (.toString svg-buffer "utf8")
   renderer (new Resvg svg-str ...)
 ```

 Now it does:

 ```clojure
   svg-str (sanitize-svg-content (.toString svg-buffer "utf8"))
   renderer (new Resvg svg-str ...)
 ```

 I also added a regression test for the <<tagtag repair in:

 - backend/test/cljs/knoxx/backend/text_test.cljs

 Validation:

 - backend pnpm exec shadow-cljs compile server passed.
 - Targeted clj-kondo still reports pre-existing size/style warnings/errors in these large files, but no new unresolved
 symbol from the patch.

 Frames

 1. The model/agent is producing malformed SVG, and the renderer was only failing to defend against it. This is the
 strongest read.
 2. The current filters are mostly inbound/memory hygiene, not outbound Discord publish gates. The ❌ reaction path
 labels messages as bad and discord.read hides labelled-bad messages, but that happens after a bad message already
 exists.
 3. The “good one plus broken one” case probably came from mixed handling: one SVG was valid enough to render to PNG,
 while another SVG hit the fallback path and got uploaded or displayed in its malformed original form.

 Countermoves

 I made the first defense-in-depth fix: sanitize SVG before outbound Discord rendering.

 There is still one remaining policy question: maybe-render-svg! currently catches render failures and uploads the
 original SVG. That fallback is useful for valid SVGs that resvg cannot handle, but unsafe if you want “never publish
 malformed SVG/XML to Discord.”

 So the next hardening step is to quarantine/drop SVG attachments when sanitization plus rendering still fails, rather
 than uploading the original.

 Next

 Restart the Knoxx backend so the Discord SVG sanitizer patch is active for new agent posts.
