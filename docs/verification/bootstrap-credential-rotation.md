# Bootstrap credential rotation — live verification

Script: [`scripts/verify-bootstrap-credential-rotation.sh`](../../scripts/verify-bootstrap-credential-rotation.sh)

This verifier exercises the browser-login credential through a real built Knoxx
process and a real transaction-capable Mongo deployment. It is the human proof
for bootstrap administrator rotation; unit doubles remain the faster regression
layer, but they do not prove that startup, HTTP auth, Mongo transactions, and
teardown work together.

## Preconditions

- Use a clean checkout at the revision being reviewed. The verifier refuses
  tracked or untracked source changes.
- Keep an OpenPlanner clone available (the sibling `../openplanner` path is the
  default; override it with `KNOXX_BOOTSTRAP_VERIFY_OPENPLANNER_ROOT`) and choose the exact OpenPlanner commit whose SDK should participate
  in the proof. The script archives that commit rather than reading its working
  tree.
- Provide `git`, `pnpm`, `mongosh`, `node`, `curl`, `jq`, `tar`, `find`, and
  `readlink`.
- Provide a Mongo replica set or sharded cluster that the verifier may create
  and drop uniquely named databases on. A standalone `mongod` is deliberately
  refused because it cannot uphold atomic credential replacement.

Run:

```bash
KNOXX_BOOTSTRAP_VERIFY_MONGODB_URI='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?replicaSet=rs0' \
KNOXX_BOOTSTRAP_VERIFY_OPENPLANNER_HEAD="$(git -C ../openplanner rev-parse HEAD)" \
  scripts/verify-bootstrap-credential-rotation.sh
```

The script records the exact Knoxx and OpenPlanner commit ids, archives both
revisions into a private sibling workspace, installs their frozen dependency
trees there, and builds the OpenPlanner SDK before rebuilding and executing
Knoxx's `backend/dist/server.js`. Every dependency symlink must resolve beneath
that private workspace; a checkout `node_modules` link, dangling dependency, or
path escape aborts before the Knoxx build. A stale ignored bundle or mutable
sibling checkout therefore cannot masquerade as evidence for either reviewed
revision, and the verification build cannot overwrite or leave artifacts in a
checkout. The script chooses fresh loopback ports and starts the process with
production local-password policy, event runtimes disabled, and an isolated
database name.

## Evidence paths

The run demonstrates four externally distinguishable states:

1. A prior bootstrap email/password in a generated former primary organization
   authenticates through `POST /api/auth/local/login` and has one active Mongo
   credential.
2. Restarting with both a new primary organization and a new email/password
   plus the prior email revokes the former-organization login, admits the
   replacement login, and leaves exactly one replacement.
3. Restarting with a blank password refuses both managed logins and leaves no
   active managed bootstrap credential.
4. In a second database, the prior credential is again seeded in the former
   organization and a collection validator rejects only the replacement in the
   new organization. Knoxx exits nonzero without binding `/health`; Mongo then
   shows the prior credential still active and no active replacement. That is
   the cross-organization rollback invariant—retirement never commits by
   itself.

The archived source, build output, HTTP bodies, and server logs live only in a
private temporary directory for the duration of the run. On success, failure,
interrupt, or termination, the script stops its child process, drops only
databases whose generated names match
`knoxx_bootstrap_verify_rotation_*` or
`knoxx_bootstrap_verify_failure_*`, and removes the temporary evidence.
Every HTTP request disables user curl configuration and proxy routing so the
generated administrator credentials remain on the intended loopback transport.

## Deployment contract

Knoxx now validates Mongo topology before policy seeding. Replica sets and
sharded clusters are admitted; standalone servers fail startup before protected
routes or the HTTP listener are composed. Configure local development Mongo as
a single-node replica set if only one host is needed.
