# Local resources, MongoDB, Proxx, and Ollama

Knoxx can run directly against the local Foresight workspace and the host
OpenPlanner/Proxx/Ollama stack without persisting another copy of their
credentials.

## Connection shape

- `WORKSPACE_ROOT` defaults to the directory containing the Knoxx checkout, so
  a checkout at `foresight/knoxx` exposes the Foresight tree as local resources.
- `MONGODB_URI` defaults to the application credential already injected into
  the running `openplanner-openplanner-1` container. The launcher rewrites only
  its network address to `127.0.0.1:27017` and enables direct replica-set access.
- `PROXX_BASE_URL` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8789`. The bearer token is read
  (as `PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN`) from `PROXX_ENV_FILE` unless `PROXX_AUTH_TOKEN` is set;
  the file defaults to `proxx/.env` beside the workspace root (i.e. a sibling of
  the Foresight checkout, not of `knoxx/`).
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:11434`, with
  `gemma4:e2b` pinned for both `publication_translator` and
  `publication_post_drafter`. Thinking is disabled for both tool-calling
  agents. Event turns run one at a time behind a 256-entry FIFO and each
  provider turn is capped at 300 seconds, so a stalled request cannot hold all
  translation and drafting work forever. Ollama is registered as an
  unauthenticated OpenAI-compatible provider at `/v1`. Translation settlement
  also uses native `/api/chat` with a strict
  one-field JSON schema when the compatibility layer returns prose instead of a
  real `save_translation` call; Knoxx never interprets call-shaped prose.
- OpenPlanner embeddings go directly to that same Ollama endpoint with
  `qwen3-embedding:8b` and an explicit 1024-dimensional contract. No Proxx bearer
  token is sent to the local embedding endpoint.

Explicit connection values always win. Set `KNOXX_LOCAL_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to
override the launcher's workspace choice; this dedicated name prevents an
unrelated shell-level `WORKSPACE_ROOT` from silently selecting another checkout.
No discovered credential is printed or written to disk.

## Verify

```bash
./scripts/verify-local-resources.sh
```

The verifier is read-only. It checks the workspace and contracts paths, MongoDB
ping, Proxx health plus authenticated model discovery, Ollama health, both
configured Ollama models, and one real finite 1024-dimensional embedding. Every
failed precondition exits non-zero.

## Run

```bash
./scripts/start-local-knoxx.sh
```

The launcher starts the backend shadow-cljs watcher and the development server
from this checkout. It defaults `KNOXX_DISABLE_EVENT_RUNTIMES=true`, so local
verification does not join Discord gateways or start schedule/event background
runtimes. Explicit document admission still dispatches its server-owned
translation and drafting events through the local dispatcher. Stop it with
Ctrl-C; the launcher also terminates its watcher. On a clean checkout it waits
for both the backend entrypoint and the ClojureScript runtime artifact, so the
server never imports a half-written watch build.

To apply the same environment to another command:

```bash
./scripts/with-local-resources.sh <command> [args...]
```

Common overrides:

```bash
KNOXX_OPENPLANNER_CONTAINER=my-openplanner \
PROXX_ENV_FILE=/path/to/proxx/.env \
OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODEL=gemma4:e2b \
EMBED_PROVIDER_MODEL=qwen3-embedding:8b \
EMBED_PROVIDER_DIMENSIONS=1024 \
./scripts/verify-local-resources.sh
```
