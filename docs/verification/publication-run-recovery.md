# Publication compatibility and run query recovery

This is a historical integrated-source proof from PR #305, not qualification of
the standalone provider layer. Its publication/HTTP fixtures and aggregate counts
belong to that source snapshot; those consumers land in later replacement PRs.
For the current run/event provider implementation, runnable proof and limits, see
[Run, event, thread and cache providers](run-event-providers.md).

The compatibility publication routes now share the Wiki publish command guard: publish capability, explicit `wiki_publish` denial, exact document ownership, and the reviewed source revision under the shared document lock. Public read visibility does not permit changing another organization's publication. A missing placement returns an opaque 404 before constructing a document scope.

Run queries return the selected provider's actual run. Missing or expired durable records never revive a stale memory record. Ordinary own-run access also requires the selected organization to match; only explicit platform administration or `agent.runs.read_all` can cross that boundary. A missing context returns 401 before accessing a provider. Event authorization runs before flushing queued events.

The focused test suite drives both actual Fastify routes through injection. Its source snapshot and final publication effects are controlled dependencies; it does not claim to reproduce the entire rendering or publication process. A real asynchronous source lock verifies that an intervening edit makes the old publication revision fail. Separate run-query tests use actual Clio files, reopen the provider, advance its clock to expiry, and corrupt the ledger to prove failures remain visible. The end-to-end browser supervisor covers real rendering and publication separately.

The focused compilation and direct guarded execution pass 34 tests containing 173 assertions, with zero failures and errors. The test compiler reports zero warnings, and integrated `pnpm typecheck` passes with 602 files and zero warnings. Existing adapter redaction tests intentionally log their classified test errors. Those messages are expected evidence that a 500 response omits internal paths; they are not compiler warnings.

The first recovery run exposed an incorrect test double: `source-dependencies` has zero- and one-argument entry points, and replacing it with a generic constant function broke the compiler's static arity dispatch. Preserving both actual arities fixed the fixture. The seven failed assertions from that attempt remain recorded; they are not counted as a passing run.

The historical proof above covered the EDN Clio run/event provider. The current
Mongo provider also implements ordered durable events using revision CAS, with
its real-process restart/concurrency proof documented in
[the current provider verifier](run-event-providers.md). OpenPlanner remains an
archival projection and cannot be selected as an exact ordered-event authority.
This provider change does not qualify the later publication/HTTP consumer layer.
